ðŸŒ¿ Terraforming Gyaros Island: A 10-Year Plan to Go Green
Year 1: Survey & Soil Preparation
Conduct environmental assessments: map soil, climate, flora, fauna.

Analyze water sources: rainfall, groundwater, evaporation.

Remediate soil with compost, biochar, and microbes.

Install fog nets and dew collectors for water harvesting.

Year 2: Water Infrastructure & Pilot Planting
Build swales, terraces, and check dams to retain rainwater.

Construct cisterns and small ponds for water storage.

Launch a native plant nursery with hardy species.

Install solar-powered drip irrigation.

Year 3: Pioneer Tree Planting
Introduce pioneer trees (acacia, mesquite, tamarisk).

Plant coastal windbreaks using tamarisk and cypress.

Expand mulching to retain moisture and suppress erosion.

Year 4: Ground Cover & Pollinator Support
Sow cover crops (clover, vetch) and native grasses.

Establish pollinator gardens (lavender, thyme, rosemary).

Create habitats for bees, birds, and beneficial insects.

Year 5: Forest Expansion
Begin planting food and habitat forests (fig, almond, pomegranate).

Designate rewilding zones for passive ecosystem recovery.

Spread fungi and decomposing matter to build healthy soil.

Year 6: Sustainable Agroecology
Introduce rotational grazing with sheep or goats.

Implement agroforestry systems (intercropped trees, herbs).

Start composting and beekeeping programs.

Year 7: Wetland Microhabitats
Build small constructed wetlands fed by greywater.

Add native aquatic plants and amphibians.

Develop drip-fed garden beds for diverse vegetables.

Year 8: Eco-Village & Research Base
Build low-impact housing with solar/wind power.

Launch environmental education and permaculture programs.

Trial eco-tourism and volunteer programs.

Year 9: Monitoring & Rebalancing
Conduct ecosystem monitoring (soil, water, biodiversity).

Adjust planting strategies and promote natural succession.

Expand passive regeneration zones.

Year 10: Fully Green Gyaros
Maintain self-sustaining food forests and wildlife zones.

Support native birds, reptiles, mammals, and pollinators.

Apply for protected status (ecological reserve, biosphere).
